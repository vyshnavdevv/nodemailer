# nodemailer
This code is a Node.js application that uses the Express framework to create a local server. Its purpose is to create an auto-reply feature for Gmail while a user is on vacation.




Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Setting up the Server: It initializes an Express application and sets up the server to run on port 3000.

Google API Authentication: It uses Google's authentication mechanism (@google-cloud/local-auth) to authenticate with Gmail using OAuth 2.0. It loads credentials from a credentials.json file.

Gmail API Usage: It uses the Google API Client Library (googleapis) to interact with the Gmail API.

Label Creation and Auto-Reply Logic:

The code checks for unread messages in the user's inbox (getUnrepliedMessages function).
It creates a label named "Vacation Auto-Reply" to tag messages that receive an auto-reply.
The main function runs at intervals and looks for unread messages. If it finds an unread message that hasn't been replied to, it crafts an auto-reply and sends it to the sender. It then adds the "Vacation Auto-Reply" label to the message and removes it from the inbox.
Server Endpoint: The root route (/) triggers the auto-reply mechanism and returns a JSON response confirming the authentication status.

In essence, this code creates a local server that periodically checks for unread messages in the Gmail inbox, sends an auto-reply for those messages that haven't been replied to, and marks them with a specific label indicating they've received an automated response.
